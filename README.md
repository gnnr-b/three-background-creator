# Three-Gen

Interactive generator for Three.js website backgrounds. Use the sliders and color pickers to create generative visual patterns, then export a standalone HTML file to embed in your site.

Quick start

- Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or serve via a simple static server).
- Tweak the controls on the right. Patterns update live.
- Click `Download HTML` to save a standalone animated HTML file `three-gen-export.html` with your current design.

Notes

- This project uses `three.js` and `lil-gui` via CDN.
- The exported HTML is self-contained (it uses the three.js CDN) and reproduces the current animated background.

Want a ZIP of full project files? Ask me and I'll add a ZIP-export button that packages the scaffold and the exported HTML.
